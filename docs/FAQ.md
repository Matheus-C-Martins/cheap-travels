# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

Answers to common questions about Cheap Travels.

## General

### What is Cheap Travels?

Cheap Travels is a web application that aggregates and displays verified travel deals (flights and cruises) with discounts of 50-90% from various sources.

### Is it free to use?

Yes! Cheap Travels is completely free to use. No registration, no subscriptions, no hidden fees.

### How do you make money?

Currently, we don't. This is an open-source project. In the future, we might add affiliate links or sponsored listings.

### Is my data safe?

Yes. We don't collect personal data. Only your preferences (language, theme, favorites) are stored locally in your browser.

## Deals

### Are the deals real?

Yes! All deals are sourced from official airline and cruise company websites. However, prices can change quickly, so we recommend booking promptly.

### How often are deals updated?

Deals are updated every 30 minutes automatically. You can also manually refresh the page.

### Why did a deal disappear?

Deals can expire, sell out, or have their prices change. We remove deals that are no longer valid.

### Can I book through your site?

No. We redirect you to the official booking site (airline, cruise company, etc.) where you complete your purchase safely.

### What if the price is different?

Prices can change between our last check and when you visit the site. Always verify the final price before booking.

### Do you guarantee the prices?

No. We display the most recent information available, but prices are subject to change. Final prices are determined by the booking site.

## Features

### How do I save deals?

Click the heart icon (❤️) on any deal card. Your favorites are saved in your browser.

### Can I access my favorites on another device?

No, favorites are stored locally. We're considering adding user accounts in the future.

Click the language selector in the top right corner and choose from 5 languages.
